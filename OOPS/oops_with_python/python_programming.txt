1- Static keyword in python?
Python does not have a 'static' keyword to declare the static variable. In Python, you simply declare a variable inside
the class, note that it should not be inside any method, and that variable will be known as a static or class variable.

static /class variable - define at class level
instance variable - inside __init__ method
local variable - inside method

Static and dynamic memory allocation -
When the allocation of memory performs at the compile time, then it is known as static memory. When the memory
allocation is done at the execution or run time, then it is called dynamic memory allocation.

Destructor Code in Python-
The destructor was called after the program ended.

class Employee:

    # Initializing
    def __init__(self):
        print('Employee created.')

    # Deleting (Calling destructor)
    def __del__(self):
        print('Destructor called, Employee deleted.')

obj = Employee()
del obj

Output:---------------------------------
Employee created.
Destructor called, Employee deleted.

2nd Example -

class Employee:

    # Initializing
    def __init__(self):
        print('Employee created')

    # Calling destructor
    def __del__(self):
        print("Destructor called")

def Create_obj():
    print('Making Object...')
    obj = Employee()
    print('function end...')
    return obj

print('Calling Create_obj() function...')
obj = Create_obj()
print('Program End...')

Output:----------------------------
Calling Create_obj() function...
Making Object...
Employee created
function end...
Program End...
Destructor called
