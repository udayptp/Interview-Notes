1- Static keyword in python?
Python does not have a 'static' keyword to declare the static variable. In Python, you simply declare a variable inside
the class, note that it should not be inside any method, and that variable will be known as a static or class variable.

static /class variable - define at class level
instance variable - inside __init__ method
local variable - inside method
